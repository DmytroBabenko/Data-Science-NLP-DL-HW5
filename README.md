#TASK 
The goal of the homework is to develop a tool for Named Entity Recog-
nition. You need to implement model "Glove word embeddings + BiLSTM + Softmax" for sequence labeling. Please, use the standard PyTorch ex-
ample for the sequence labeling task "Sequence models and long-short term
memory networks" as a basic code to start. 
See details in DL-NLP-homework.pdf

#Solution
As a report, please see NER_detection_runner.ipynb jupyter notebook 
and NER_detection_runner-colab.ipynb (the same running on colab). <br>
NER_detection_runner-colab.ipynb provides more detailed results, because there were running for 5 epochs for full dataset.<br>
NER_detection_runner.ipynb provides all neccessary information also, but there were running on rerstricted dataset, because it took too much time on local PC.
